# About

API documentation for Re.Pack is split into few categories:

- [`@callstack/repack`](./repack/index) - documentation for APIs used to configure bundling or development processes: Webpack plugins, utilities and commands.
- [`@callstack/repack/client`](./repack/client/index) - documentation for client-facing APIs, which you can use inside your application, for example `ScriptManager`.
- [`@callstack/repack-dev-server`](./dev-server/index) - documentation for bundler-agnostic development server. Unless, you're trying to integrate a bundler other than Webpack, this API will not be useful to you.
